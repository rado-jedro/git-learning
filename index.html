                January falls the snow,<br>
                February cold winds blow,<br>
                In March peep out the early flowers,<br>
                And April comes with sunny showers.<br> <br>
                In May the roses bloom so gay,<br>
                In June the farmer mows his hay,<br>
                In July brightly shines the sun,<br>
                In August harvest is begun.<br><br>
                September turns the green leaves brown,<br>
                October winds then shake them down,<br>
                November fills with bleak and smear,<br>
                December comes and ends the year.<br>
